<h2>Sketch Feature Extractor Python 2.7 Implementation</h2>

We implemented the sketch feature extraction mechanism <!--more--> mentioned in the following paper:
[http://rationale.csail.mit.edu/publications/Ouyang2009IJCAI.pdf](http://rationale.csail.mit.edu/publications/Ouyang2009IJCAI.pdf)

<h3>Usage</h3>
* Download the files
* Run `python setup.py build` to build the code
* Run `python setup.py install` to install the module (this action may require sudo privileges)
* You can try running the following code to see if it is working:

```
from sketchfe import FeatureExtractor
idm = FeatureExtractor.IDMFeatureExtractor()
idm.extractimage_test()
```

<h3>The format of the symbol sketches</h3>
A sketch is defined as a set of strokes including ink points. Sketched symbols can be in 3 different formats that are described below.

The following examples refer to the same sketch.

<h4>JSON</h4>
```
{"id":"asdasd",
 "strokes":
	[{"id":"1","points":[{"pid":"qwe","time":4.6,"x":1,"y":9},{"pid":"aty","time":8,"x":6,"y":5}]},
	{"id":"21","points":[{"pid":"uio","time":9,"x":10.2,"y":44.4},{"pid":"asd","time":12,"x":3,"y":77},{"pid":"cvb","time":13,"x":5,"y":7}]
	}]
}
```

<h4>XML</h4>
```
<sketch id="1">
	<point id="1" time="4.6" x="1" y="9" />
	<point id="2" time="8" x="6" y="5" />
	<point id="3" time="9" x="10.2" y="44.4" />
	<point id="4" time="12" x="3" y="77" />
	<point id="5" time="13" x="5" y="7" />
	<stroke id="1">
		<arg type="point">1</arg>
		<arg type="point">2</arg>
	</stroke>
	<stroke id="2">
		<arg type="point">3</arg>
		<arg type="point">4</arg>
		<arg type="point">5</arg>
	</stroke>
</sketch>
```

<h4>Points as table</h4>
```
1\t9\t0\t4.6\n6\t5\t0\t8\n10.2\t44.4\t1\t9\n3\t77\t1\t12\n5\t7\t1\t13
```

The next version will include more feature extraction methods.

<h3>Loading sketches from files</h3>
This library has built-in functions to load sketches from XML, JSON and points-as-table files (see the previous section for the content organization of these types). Sample usage of these functions are given below.

<h4>Loading a sketch from an XML file</h4>
```
from sketchfe import shapecreator
filename = "sketch.xml" #the name of the sketch file
with open(filename,'rb') as f:
     filecontent = f.read()
     loadedSketch = shapecreator.buildSketch('xml',filecontent)
```

<h4>Loading a sketch from a JSON file</h4>
```
from sketchfe import shapecreator
filename = "sketch.json" #the name of the sketch file
with open(filename,'rb') as f:
     filecontent = f.read()
     loadedSketch = shapecreator.buildSketch('json',filecontent)
```

<h4>Loading a sketch from a points table text file</h4>
```
from sketchfe import shapecreator
filename = "sketch.txt" #the name of the sketch file
with open(filename,'rb') as f:
     filecontent = f.read()
     loadedSketch = shapecreator.buildSketch('school',filecontent)
```

<h3>Extracting Features</h3>
By creating an instance of `IDMFeatureExtractor` , which is a sub-class of `FeatureExtractor`, you can extract features of a sketched symbol that is represented as an instance of `Sketch` class. The following code snippet basically extracts feature of a `Sketch` instance `sk`:

```
import sketchfe.FeatureExtractor.IDMFeatureExtractor
featextractor = IDMFeatureExtractor()
features = featextractor.extract(sk) # features includes the feat. representation as an array
```
